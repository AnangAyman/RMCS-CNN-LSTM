# Sign Language Learning App

This repository contains the necessary resources for training the paper " Lightweight Hybrid CNN-LSTM for Sign Language Recognition in Low-Resource Environments"

## Overview

The Sign Language Learning App utilizes a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for recognizing and teaching sign language.

## Repository Contents

This GitHub repository includes:

- **Training File**: The code used for training the hybrid CNN-LSTM model.
- **Poster**: A visual summary of the project.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training the model.
